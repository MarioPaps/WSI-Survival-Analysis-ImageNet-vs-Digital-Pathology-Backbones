# WSI-Survival-Analysis-ImageNet-vs-Digital-Pathology-Backbones

## Abstract
The abundance of information present in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) renders them an essential tool for survival analysis. Several Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks proposed for this task utilize
a ResNet50 backbone pre-trained on natural images. By leveraging recently released histopathological foundation models such as UNI and Hibou, the predictive prowess of existing MIL networks
can be enhanced. 
Furthermore, deploying an ensemble of digital pathology foundation models yields higher accuracy, although the benefits appear to diminish with more complex MIL architectures.
